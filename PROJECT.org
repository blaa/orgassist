 #+TITLE: OrgAssist project management

* Bugs
** TODO Make sleekxmpp work over socks proxy or over tunneled port
   Currently tunneled port breaks TLS domain checking.
   Certificate is for SRV record, not for JID domain.

   Update: I lacked pyasn1 on one server and it didn't verify cert there at all.
   Where: sleekxmpp: cert.py / verify() 
   gets expected from jid. tries to get srv from cert (but doesn't; and can it?)
   Maybe my cert is bad but pidgin likes it.
** DONE Show nice info when config file can't be found
   CLOSED: [2018-06-02 Sat 19:17]
** DONE Show '--now--' marker after all the appointments

    Possibly - use gettext within Jinja templates.
*** TODO Use gettext for short messages.
** Improve Agenda                                                       :CAL:

   - Search through all events in the calendar.
   - Narrow down in consecutive queries, helm-like.
   - Remember last search for X minutes.
** TODO Implement a shell "execute" plugin
   Avoid shell-expansions etc. Try to keep it safe.
** TODO Notify user life about agenda changes                           :CAL:
   - someone created new event
   - removed one (or changed status)
   - rescheduled to different hour
** TODO OWA plugin: Gather events from OWA calendar                     :OWA:
** TODO Handle a "private" tag                                          :ORG:
   - Hide headlines of private tags

   - Short description of each command.
** TODO Handle dates in "note" command in smart way
   detect date:
   2018-08-10
   mm-dd (this or next months in this year)
   mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun (next)
   hh:mm - hour, minute
   And schedule using given date (or treat as appointment?)

* Tasks
** TODO Settle on a name.
   - orgassist is not completely unique name.
   - I'm trying to use gender neutral names.
   - http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/assistant
     orgally? orgmate?
     botally, botmate seem taken
   - "orgremote" is technical, but unique.
   - "orgbot" is taken, but seems to be a dead repo.

** TODO Deploy a work-instance.
** TODO Make sure all important stuff gets log.info().
   - Note taken on [2018-06-02 Sat 11:24] \\
     In progress; started converting old prints() and adding logging.
   For answers like "why didn't I get that important notification"
** TODO Store information about org events source                       :ORG:
   Alter orgnode and org helpers to store file&line of all org events during
   reading. Keep a start line and a last line of event.
** TODO Remember the "context" event within calendar.                   :CAL:
** TODO Implement a simple library for low-impact edition of org files. :ORG:
   - No required IDs.
   - Change only those lines that need changing.
   - Handle state change.
   - Handle date updates: moving scheduled, deadline, other dates.
** TODO Run CI on travis.
** TODO Create functions for human readable date printing
   - in 2 days, in 2 hours, 2 days ago, etc.
   - for scheduling: 2d, 2h, 1w2d.
** TODO Disambiguation using 'plugin:' prefix for commands.
** TODO Don't use naive datetimes, handle timezones or at least prepare for it.

* Half-baked ideas
** Communication plugins
*** Facebook messenger bot
    email/password approach:
    https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat

    sleekxmpp approach:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16902171/send-a-facebook-message-with-xmpp-using-access-tokens-in-python
*** IRC plugin
    - Watchout for spoofing: Detect boss by it's address, not only a nickname.
**** Choose a library
     - SASL support
     - TLS support

     http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/

     uses it's own irc.py:
     https://github.com/rmmh/skybot/blob/master/core/irc.py
     https://github.com/sbp/phenny

*** REST interface
    - Use API key to identify boss?
    - Local interface for easier integrations?

*** Android notification system
    https://pushover.net/

** When notyfing try to group messages                                  :CAL:
   or maybe always show also "next after that" event?
** Integrate with home automation
   Like: https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant
** Forward notifications from weechat.
** Weather plugin: based on wttr.in or direct weather source.
   https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in

** Do a RNN natural-language talking bot.
   Pheh. Certainly doable, but makes sense only to let other people talk to your
   bot and schedule an appointment with you without using "commands". Kind of
   obvious idea, requires a lot of data to train the network. I'm not interested
   currently in pursuing it.

* Old command ideas
  #+begin_src yaml
  defaults:
    enable_commands:
      # Send current agenda
      - agenda
      # What should I do next? (displays and selects the task)
      - next
      # Select one of the tasks to perform an action on it.
      - select
      # Remind me what am I supposed to be doing?
      - now
      # Mark selected task as done
      - done
      # status [done|todo|delegated] - set status
      - status
      # Take a fast note; it gets selected afterwards
      - note
      # Reschedule selected note (+1d, +1w, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
      - schedule
      # Count me time on selected task
      - clockin
      # Clock me out
      - clockout
  #+end_src
